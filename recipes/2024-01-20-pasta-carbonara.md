## Ingredients (Serves 4)

- 400g spaghetti or tonnarelli
- 200g guanciale (or pancetta), diced
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
- 100g Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Salt for pasta water

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the cheese mixture**: In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, and grated Pecorino Romano. Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.

2. **Cook the guanciale**: In a large skillet, cook the diced guanciale over medium heat until crispy and golden (about 5-7 minutes). Don't drain the fat!

3. **Cook the pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook spaghetti until al dente (usually 1 minute less than package directions).

4. **Reserve pasta water**: Before draining, save 1 cup of the starchy pasta cooking water.

5. **Combine everything**: Working quickly, add the hot drained pasta to the skillet with guanciale. Remove from heat.

6. **Create the sauce**: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing vigorously. Add pasta water gradually until you achieve a creamy consistency.

7. **Serve immediately**: Plate the carbonara and top with additional Pecorino Romano and black pepper.

## Pro Tips

- **Temperature control**: The pan should be off the heat when adding eggs to prevent scrambling.
- **Quality ingredients**: Use real Pecorino Romano and guanciale for authentic flavor.
- **Timing is everything**: Have everything ready before you start - this dish comes together very quickly.
- **Pasta water is magic**: The starchy water helps create the silky sauce texture.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Don't add cream - traditional carbonara doesn't use it!
- Don't let the eggs scramble - keep the heat low when combining
- Don't use pre-grated cheese - freshly grated melts much better
