## About This Recipe

This Persian-Italian fusion dish brings together the best of both worlds - tender shrimp and mushrooms with aromatic Persian herbs, all tossed with rice pasta and finished with cream and cheese.

## Ingredients

- Rice pasta
- Fresh basil, washed and drained
- Mixed mushrooms, cut into thirds
- Butter
- Fresh shrimp
- 1-2 garlic cloves, minced
- Cabbage, chopped
- Bell pepper, chopped
- Ginger powder
- Turmeric
- Black pepper
- Cream
- Cheese
- Oil for cooking

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the basil**: Wash the fresh basil thoroughly and drain well. Set aside.

2. **Cook the pasta**: Bring a pot of water to boil for the rice pasta. Rice pasta takes about 10 minutes to cook, so time this carefully - the water should be ready when you need to add the pasta, ensuring it doesn't overcook.

3. **Cook mushrooms**: Cut all mushrooms into thirds and sauté them in butter over medium heat. Transfer the cooked mushrooms to a plate and set aside.

4. **Cook shrimp**: In the same pan, sauté the shrimp with minced garlic in butter over medium heat. Cook for 5-6 minutes until the shrimp water evaporates and they change color completely. Set aside with the mushrooms.

5. **Prepare vegetables**: Sauté the chopped cabbage and bell pepper in oil. Add the spices (ginger powder, turmeric, and black pepper). Cover and let the vegetables soften.

6. **Combine ingredients**: When the vegetables are slightly tender, turn off the heat and add the cooked mushrooms and shrimp back to the pan.

7. **Final assembly**: Add the cream, cheese, and fresh basil to the pan. Finally, add the cooked pasta and toss everything together.

8. **Serve**: Serve immediately while hot.

## Tips for Success

- **Timing is key**: Coordinate the pasta cooking with the other components
- **Don't overcook the shrimp**: They should be just cooked through
- **Fresh herbs matter**: The basil adds a wonderful aromatic finish

This fusion dish represents the beautiful marriage of Persian and Italian cuisines, creating something unique and delicious!
