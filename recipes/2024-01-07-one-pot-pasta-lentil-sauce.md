## About the Lentil Sauce

Instead of meat, we use a can of healthy, protein-packed green lentils. They just blend in and add texture, so lentil skeptics needn't worry. The sauce gets extra flavor and richness from melting cheese in - a really worthwhile addition that gives the tomato sauce a boost since it doesn't get a huge amount of time to develop flavor.

## Variations You Can Try

**Mix up the cheese**: I used cheddar cheese but you could use any favorite. The flavor could be amazing with a little blue cheese thrown in.

**Add flavor boosters**: Try a jar of red pesto or some red wine.

**Add veggies**: When cooking the garlic, add mushrooms, peppers, or anything you have. Or mix in spinach right at the end.

## One Pot Pasta Tips

The **liquid to pasta ratio** needs to be just right. The pasta will soak up liquid while it cooks, but you don't want too much or it will be soupy.

- If using thick pasta with long cook time (expensive brands, rigatoni): add more water during cooking
- If using lighter pasta with shorter cook time (macaroni): reduce starting water

## The Process

1. Saut√© garlic, herbs and lentils briefly
2. Add tinned tomatoes and sauce ingredients  
3. Add dry pasta and water
4. Simmer until pasta is cooked
5. Melt in cheese to create thick, creamy sauce
