## About This Recipe

This healthy apple crisp has all real, whole ingredients like oats, almond flour, nuts, cinnamon, coconut oil, and pure maple syrup. It's free of refined sugar, so the only sweetener is just a tiny bit of maple syrup, plus the natural sweetness of the apples.

I used Granny Smith apples, which are awesome for baking since they're relatively firm and hold up well during baking without turning to mush. They're also tart, which adds a nice contrast to the sweetness of the crumble topping.

## Why This Recipe Works

- **Naturally gluten-free** - Made with almond flour instead of wheat flour
- **Naturally vegan** - Until you add ice cream on top!
- **Refined sugar-free** - Sweetened only with maple syrup and natural apple sweetness
- **Protein and healthy fats** - From almond flour and nuts
- **Perfect texture** - Crispy topping with tender apples
