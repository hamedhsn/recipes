## About This Recipe

This light shrimp fried quinoa is a fantastic healthy alternative to traditional fried rice. By using quinoa instead of rice and egg whites instead of whole eggs, you get a dish that's:

- **High in protein** - From quinoa, shrimp, and egg whites
- **Lower in calories** - Thanks to egg whites and quinoa
- **Gluten-free** - Naturally gluten-free quinoa
- **Quick and easy** - Ready in under 30 minutes

## Why Quinoa?

Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids. It's also:
- Higher in protein than rice
- Rich in fiber
- Contains iron and magnesium
- Has a lovely nutty flavor and fluffy texture

## Why Egg Whites?

Using egg whites instead of whole eggs:
- Reduces calories significantly
- Increases protein content
- Creates a lighter texture
- Still provides the classic "fried rice" experience

## Cooking Tips

1. **Cook quinoa ahead**: Quinoa works best when it's been cooked and cooled, similar to fried rice
2. **High heat**: Use high heat for that authentic "wok hei" flavor
3. **Don't overcook shrimp**: They cook quickly and can become rubbery
4. **Season at the end**: Add soy sauce and seasonings at the end to prevent burning

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve as a main dish for lunch or dinner
- Great for meal prep - stores well in the fridge
- Add vegetables like peas, carrots, or bell peppers for extra nutrition
- Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds
