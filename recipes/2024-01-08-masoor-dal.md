When the skies are drab and life feels a little gray, I am absurdly cheered by the fresh brightness of this vibrantly orange dal. Just seeing that mixture in the pan lifts my spirits. 

It helps that a dal is simple to make: a bit of chopping and the stew all but cooks itself. And it can be made in advance and then reheated, always a bonus.

## The Magic of Red Lentils

Red lentils (masoor dal) cook quickly and break down to create a creamy, thick consistency. Combined with turmeric, they create that beautiful golden-orange color that's so visually appealing and mood-lifting.

The addition of sweet potatoes and tomatoes not only enhances the color but adds natural sweetness and acidity that balances the earthy lentils perfectly.
