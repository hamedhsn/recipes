## Ingredients

- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat your oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, beat softened butter with both sugars until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. **Add eggs and vanilla**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla.

5. **Combine wet and dry**: Gradually blend in the flour mixture until just combined. Don't overmix!

6. **Fold in chocolate chips**: Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.

7. **Shape and bake**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 9-11 minutes or until golden brown.

8. **Cool**: Let cool on baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

## Tips for Success

- **Room temperature ingredients**: Make sure your eggs and butter are at room temperature for better mixing.
- **Don't overbake**: Cookies will look slightly underdone when you remove them, but they'll continue cooking on the hot pan.
- **Chill the dough**: For thicker cookies, chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container for up to one week. You can also freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months.
