## Ingredients

- 1 French glass cup lentils, half-cooked
- 1 onion
- 3-4 potatoes
- 2 tablespoons chickpea flour (ard nokhod)
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds (soaked in 3 tablespoons water for 5 minutes)
- Salt, pepper, and turmeric to taste
- Grated ginger
- Oil for frying

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the lentils**: Cook the lentils until they are half-done (still have some bite to them). Drain and set aside.

2. **Prepare the chia egg**: Soak chia seeds in water for 5 minutes until they form a gel-like consistency.

3. **Process the vegetables**: In a food processor, first crush the onion until finely chopped. Then add the potatoes and process until well chopped.

4. **Combine ingredients**: Add the half-cooked lentils to the food processor and pulse until everything is well combined but still has some texture.

5. **Season the mixture**: Transfer to a bowl and add chickpea flour, chia seed mixture, salt, pepper, turmeric, and grated ginger. Mix well until the mixture holds together.

6. **Form patties**: Shape the mixture into small patties with your hands.

7. **Fry the kotlets**: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Fry the patties until golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.

8. **Serve**: Serve hot with rice, bread, or salad.

These protein-rich patties are perfect for a healthy lunch or dinner and can be made ahead and frozen for later use!
